# Available pipelines

This folder refers to different pipelines that can be used for various purposes in Arbeitsgruppe Walz.
If there is a request for a new pipeline, then you can make the request in the pipeline channel in slack.

## Rules
* When using a repository, keep the folder structure as it is, meaning download the whole directory and dont move the content after downloading it
* Notify your bioinformatician if there is a problem with the code (error, enhancements, etc) by making an issue in the respective repository
* If there is information missing in the README, then please contribute to improve it
